Celsius to Fahrenheit Converter Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input a temperature in Celsius
- Calculates the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit using the formula F = (C Ã— 9/5) + 32
- Displays the result

Features:

- User input for temperature in Celsius
- Use of multiplication and division operators for temperature conversion
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./celsius_to_fahrenheit
    - On Windows: celsius_to_fahrenheit.exe
4. Enter the temperature in Celsius when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using floating-point variables and arithmetic operators
- Working with mathematical formulas and conversions
- Basic program structure and syntax
